1. Python Basics
What is Python?
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability and simplicity. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991.

Key Features:

Readability: Python's syntax is clear and easy to understand, making it accessible for beginners.
Interpreted Language: Python code is executed line-by-line, which makes debugging easier.
Dynamically Typed: Variable types are determined at runtime, which simplifies coding.
Extensive Standard Library: Python has a rich set of modules and libraries for various tasks.
Cross-Platform: Python can run on various operating systems such as Windows, macOS, and Linux.
Community Support: A large and active community contributes to a wealth of resources and libraries.
Use Cases:

Web Development: Using frameworks like Django and Flask.
Data Science and Machine Learning: With libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn.
Automation and Scripting: For automating repetitive tasks.
Software Development: Building desktop and web applications.
Scientific Computing: Utilizing libraries like SciPy.

2. Installing Python
Steps to Install Python:

For Windows:

Download Python from python.org.
Run the installer and ensure "Add Python to PATH" is checked.
Follow the installation steps.

Set Up a Virtual Environment:

Install virtualenv (if not already installed):
 bash

    pip install virtualenv

Create a virtual environment:
bash

    virtualenv myenv

Activate the virtual environment:
Windows: myenv\Scripts\activate

3. Python Syntax and Semantics
Simple Python Program:

python

    print("Hello, World!")
    #print: A built-in function to display output.
    #"Hello, World!": A string argument to the print function.

4. Data Types and Variables

Basic Data Types:

int: Integer values.
float: Floating-point numbers.
str: Strings or text.
bool: Boolean values (True or False).
list: Ordered collection of items.
tuple: Ordered, immutable collection of items.
dict: Unordered collection of key-value pairs.
set: Unordered collection of unique items. 

# Integers
age = 25

# Floats
height = 5.9

# Strings
name = "John Doe"

# Booleans
is_student = True

# Lists
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Tuples
coordinates = (10.0, 20.0)

# Dictionaries
person = {
    "name": "Alice",
    "age": 30,
    "is_student": False
}

# Sets
unique_numbers = {1, 2, 3, 3, 4}

print(age, height, name, is_student, numbers, coordinates, person, unique_numbers)

5. Control Structures

Conditional Statements:

    age = 20
    if age >= 18:
        print("Adult")
    else:
        print("Minor")

For Loop:

    for i in range(5):
        print(i)

While Loop:

    count = 0
    while count < 5:
        print(count)
        count += 1

6. Functions in Python

What are Functions?
Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task. They help in organizing code and avoiding repetition.

def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b

# Calling the function
result = add_numbers(5, 3)
print(result)

7. Lists and Dictionaries

Lists vs. Dictionaries:

Lists are ordered collections of items accessed by index.
Dictionaries are collections of key-value pairs accessed by key.

#List

    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    numbers.append(6)
    print(numbers)

#Dictionary

    person = {
        "name": "Alice",
        "age": 30
    }
    person["city"] = "New York"
    print(person)

Exception handling allows a program to deal with runtime errors gracefully, without crashing.

    try:
        result = 10 / 0

        print("Cannot divide by zero")
    finally:
        print("This will execute no matter what")

9. Modules and Packages
Modules and Packages:

Modules are individual files containing Python code.
Packages are collections of modules organized in directories.

Importing and Using a Module:

    import math

    print(math.sqrt(16))

10. File I/O
Reading from a File:

    with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
        content = file.read()
        print(content)

Writing to a File:

    lines = ["Line 1", "Line 2", "Line 3"]

    with open('output.txt', 'w') as file:
        for line in lines:
            file.write(line + '\n')
